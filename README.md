# ComputerSecurity-CS419

These projects focused on various topics in the world of computer security.

Assignment 3:
Focuses on implementing your own C program to retrieve the system time.  This focuses on using function interposition to make your own user-defined function be called in order to get the time of day rather than relying on the time() C library function.


Assignment 4:
Focuses on the concept of buffer overflow.  This assignment makes the user use the gdb debugger to figure out how to read the end of the string buffer.


CipherProject:
Focuses on generating programs to crack substitution ciphers.  The first part focuses on using a brute force approach to crack a Ceasar cipher, while the second part focuses on using frequency analysis to crack a monoalphabetic cipher.


CryptrProgram:
Focuses on sharing files over the internet with encryption and decryption.  Here I learned about the concept of private, public, and secret keys as well as using them to encrypt/decrypt files over the internet.
